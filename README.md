1. Introduction to the Dataset:
Dataset Name: Student Performance
Source: Kaggle
Overview: This dataset includes information about students’ academic performance and factors that influence their grades, including parental education, tutoring, study time, absences, and extracurricular activities.

Key Data Points:

Parental Education: Education level of the student's parents.
Gender: Student gender.
Study Time: Amount of time students spend studying.
Extracurricular Activities: Activities students participate in (e.g., sports, music).
GPA: Grade Point Average of students.


2. Objective of the Dashboard:
The dashboard aims to analyze and visualize key factors influencing student performance, such as parental education, extracurricular activities, and absences. It provides insights for school administrators, teachers, and policymakers to improve educational outcomes.


3. Dashboard Layout Explanation:
The dashboard is organized into 8 main sections, each with its own visualization.

Visualization 1: Total Students Count

Top Left: The total number of students is displayed, along with a breakdown of male (1170) and female (1222) students.
Insight: Gender distribution is roughly equal, with a slightly higher number of female students.


Visualization 2: GPA Analysis Based on Parental Education

A bar chart showing the average GPA of students based on their parents' education levels.
Insight: Students whose parents have a high school education or higher tend to have slightly higher GPAs.


Visualization 3: Absences Across Gender

A horizontal bar chart displays the number of absences by gender.
Insight: Female students have slightly more absences compared to male students.


Visualization 4: GPA Analysis Based on Tutoring and Parental Support

This bar chart shows the correlation between tutoring (yes/no) and parental support (high/low/none) with students' GPA.
Insight: Students receiving tutoring and higher parental support tend to have better GPAs.


Visualization 5: Student Activity Analysis

A clustered bar chart comparing students who participate in extracurricular activities (e.g., sports, music) versus those who don’t.
Insight: Volunteering and sports have high participation rates, and students participating in extracurricular activities generally have better outcomes.


Visualization 6: Correlation Between Study Time and GPA

A bar chart showing the relationship between the amount of study time (in hours) and GPA.
Insight: Moderate study time (around 12–18 hours) shows a strong correlation with higher GPAs.


Visualization 7: Student Distribution by Grade Class

A pie chart depicting the distribution of students across different grade classes (A, B, C, D, F).
Insight: Most students fall in the 'A' grade class, followed by 'B'.


4. Interactivity Features (Slicers):
Slicers are used to enable dynamic filtering, enhancing the interactivity of the dashboard:
Gender: Filter data based on male or female students.
Parental Education: Filter results based on different levels of parental education.
Grade Class: Enables filtering students based on their grade class (A, B, C, D, F).
How It Helps: By using these slicers, you can quickly analyze specific sub-groups of students, such as female students with parents who have a bachelor's degree, and examine their performance.


5. Key Insights from the Dashboard:
Parental Education Impact: Students with parents who have higher education tend to perform better.

Absences: Female students tend to have slightly more absences, which could impact their academic performance.

Tutoring and Parental Support: Students with tutoring and high parental support achieve better GPAs.

Extracurricular Activities: Involvement in extracurricular activities, especially volunteering, is associated with better student performance.

Study Time and GPA: There is a strong correlation between study time and GPA, with moderate study time yielding the highest GPA.


6. Conclusion:
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of student performance, allowing educators and school administrators to identify key factors influencing academic outcomes. By using slicers, decision-makers can target specific student groups and tailor interventions to improve educational strategies.
